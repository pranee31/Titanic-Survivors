# Titanic-Survivors

## Description
This project aims to analyze the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and fare. It uses data visualization and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and correlations that influence survival.

## Features
Data exploration: Visualization of the dataset to understand the distribution of features like age, gender, class, and fare.
Survival prediction: Use of machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict survival based on the provided features.
Correlation analysis: Identifying the key features that influence survival rates.

  Key findings:
  - Most survivors were from 1st class, female, and under 18 years old.
  - The fare was a significant factor in survival.
  - The survival rate was higher for passengers who boarded in Southampton.

  Conclusion:
  - The survival prediction model provides a reasonable accuracy rate.
  - The dataset's limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting results.
